# URetro
please come up with a better name than this

This is a WIP libretro frontend for Wii U. Currently reads libretro core and asks it's API version. 

A temporary upload of stella.elf (our test libretro core) is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d8hcmriz5fikzjk/stella.elf?dl=1). Throw that on the root of your SD card and you should be good.

## Cloning
Don't forget to `git clone --recursive` or you won't get our submodules!

## libretro
`/src/api/libretro.h` is the big one!
